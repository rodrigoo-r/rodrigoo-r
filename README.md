  <h3>📚 A little more about me</h3>
</div> 

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer. I started coding in 2014, and have touched tons of systems ever since; 
and I created [The Celery C++ STL](https://github.com/rodrigoo-r/Celery), a high-performance STL, and
[The Zelix Programming Language](https://github.com/zelix-lang/zelix), a mission-critial and formally
verified high-performance programming language, alongside with other projects.

I founded [Linezed](https://github.com/Linezed) in 2025 and I'm still building it, one step at a time.
